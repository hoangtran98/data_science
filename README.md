# Logistic Regression Model for Detecting Cat in images

<p>This contains one of my courseworks instructed by Andrew Ng in Deep Learning Specilisation Series. The main goal of this is to build a neural network on the basis of logistic regression to do simple classification tasks.</p>

<p>Feel free to check out the source code in Jupyter Notebook to see how they are all put together</p>
